## Description

This is the assignment of [Natural Computing](https://www.learn.ed.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContent.jsp?course_id=_62439_1&content_id=_2996260_1&mode=reset)
 and the intruduction of the assignment can be found [here](https://www.learn.ed.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-3468465-dt-content-rid-6819223_1/courses/INFR111612018-9SV1SEM1/nat2018_assignment.pdf).
 In the introduction we need to find a paper and reproduce the algorithm. The algorithm we choose to reproduce is the [WCA(Water cycle algorithm) written by Hadi Eskandar](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045794912001770).
 After reproduce WCA, we use [PSO algorithm](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/494215) as a benchmark to make a comparsion.
